Silly solutions for proposed problems.

## How to run

Each file can be run with just basic NodeJS.

Clone the repository and check a solution by running <code>node \<folder name></code> in the console.

For example:

```
// to check solution for leap year task run
node leap-year
```

Each file contains console logs with examples. You can add your own logs to check other options if needed.
